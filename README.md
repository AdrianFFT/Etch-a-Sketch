# Etch-a-Sketch
Second JS Odin Project
Solution was taken from stack overflow
Commented code was my solution but it only works until you need to resize the grid.
I saw a lot of solutions using repeat function from CSS Grid. I didnt want to use that. 
I just needed to create the rows and add that to the container, but because of naming issues, 
I have decided to copy the code to save the time.
